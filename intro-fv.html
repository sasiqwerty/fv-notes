    <h2 id="1-thalidomide-and-introduction">1. Thalidomide and Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning, there was thalidomide. The history of drug safety goes
      back further but, for practical purposes, the story of modern
      pharmacovigilance begins there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 1950s there was little, if any, regulation of medicines
      out-side the USA (where thalidomide was not allowed on to the market), and
      their testing and development was almost entirely in the hands of
      pharmaceutical companies. In the case of thalidomide,
      <em>unjustified claims of safety in pregnancy were made</em>, and its use
      as a sedative and treatment for nausea and vomiting was targeted at
      pregnant women. The drug turned out to be a <strong>teratogen</strong>,
      producing a variety of birth defects but particularly limb defects known
      as phocomelia (Figure 1.1). Worldwide, about 10â000 babies were affected,
      particularly in Germany where the drug was first marketed. As phocomelia
      was otherwise a very rare congenital abnormality, a major increase in its
      incidence did not go unnoticed in Germany, but the cause was initially
      thought to be environmental. In 1961, a series of just three cases of
      congenital anomalies associated with thalidomide use in Australia was
      reported in The Lancet, the problem was finally recognised and the drug
      with-drawn from sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the 1960s, publication of possible adverse effects of
      drugs in the medical literature was effectively the only mechanism for
      drawing attention to them. Thalidomide produced a nonâlethal but visible
      and shocking adverse effect, leading people to ask why so many damaged
      babies had been born before anything had been done? This question is
      central to subsequent developments. It is unlikely that we will ever be
      able to predict and prevent all the harms that may be caused by medicines,
      but limiting the damage to much smaller numbers is now achievable. Today
      we would expect to be able to Â­identify an association between drug and
      outcome analogous to thalidomide and phocomelia after the occurrence of
      less than 10 cases, so at least three orders of magnitude more effectively
      than six decades ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overriding lesson learnt from thalidomide was that we cannot just wait
      until a drug safety problem hits us. The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s
      led directly to the initial development of the systems we have in place
      today, although it is only since the early 1990s that the term
      pharmacovigilance has become widely accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pharmacovigilance</strong> is defined by the World Health
      Organization as
      <em
        >âThe science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
        understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drugâ
        related problems.â</em
      >
      There are other definitions but this very broad one seems to be the most
      appropriate because there is a clear implication that the process is one
      of risk management.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a concept that is applicable to many aspects of modern life but,
      surprisingly, its explicit use in relation to pharmaceuticals is a fairly
      recent development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thalidomide is not merely of historical interest, as in recent years it
      has made a comeback on to the market in some countries but with very
      narrow indications and extensive safeguards. The reasons for this
      exemplify the point about risk management, as the risk of fetal
      malformation can be successfully managed by avoidance of the drug during
      pregnancy. It also demonstrates another concept that is central to the
      practice of pharmacovigilance â the balance of benefit and risk.
      Thalidomide has benefits in some diseases that are otherwise difficult to
      treat (e.g. refractory multiple myeloma) and these appear to out-weigh the
      risk of fetal malformation if there is an effective pregnancy prevention
      scheme in place. A further point that thalidomide illustrates well â and
      which is relevant to many other drug safety issues â is that not everyone
      is at the same risk of a particular adverse effect. In this case, a
      substantial part of the population (including men and also women who are
      not of childbearing capacity) are not at risk of phocomelia.
    </p>
    <h3 id="11-main-lessons-learned-from-thalidomide">
      1.1. Main Lessons Learned from Thalidomide
    </h3>
    <p>The thalidomide tragedy taught us many lessons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The need for adequate testing of medicines prior to marketing.</li>
      <li>The need for government regulation of medicines.</li>
      <li>
        The need for reporting systems to identify the adverse effects of
        medicines.
      </li>
      <li>The potential safety implications of unproven marketing claims.</li>
      <li>
        Most medicines cross the placenta and this results in fetal exposure.
      </li>
      <li>Avoidance of unnecessary use of medicines in pregnancy.</li>
      <li>That some risks can be successfully minimised.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The ramifications of the thalidomide tragedy were manyfold, but the key
      lesson for the development of pharmacovigilance was that active systems
      for detecting hazards are needed. Within a few years this had been taken
      forward with the introduction of voluntary (or âspontaneousâ) schemes for
      reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These have stood the
      test of time as an alerting mechanism or early warning system, and are
      covered in more detail in Chapter 3.
    </p>
    <h2 id="2-scope%C2%AD-and-purposes-of-pharmacovigilance">
      2. ScopeÂ­ and Purposes of Pharmacovigilance
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the past, the process of pharmacovigilance has often been considered to
      start when a drug is first authorised for use in ordinary practiceÂ­.
      Nowadays, it is more commonly considered to include all safetyârelated
      activity beyond the point at which humans are first exposed to a new
      medicinal product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate purpose of pharmacovigilance is to minimise, in practice, the
      potential for harm that is associated with all active medicines. Although
      data about all types of ADRs are collected, a key focus is on identifying
      and preventing those that are defined to be serious. This is generally
      defined as an ADR that meets at least one of the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Fatal</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lifeâthreatening</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Causes or prolongs hospitalisation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Results in longâterm disability</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All congenital anomalies.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The definition of serious also allows the application of medical
      judgement, such that a reaction can be considered serious even if there is
      not clear evidence that one of the above criteria is met. Nonâserious
      reactions are important to individual patients and health Â­professionals
      involved in their treatment, but they can usually be managed clinically
      and impact less on the balance of benefit and risk for individual products
      and on public health in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, pharmacovigilance can be seen as a public health function in which
      reductions in the occurrence of serious harms are achievable through
      measures that promote the safest possible use of medicinal products and/or
      provide specific safeguards against known hazards. Pregnancy prevention in
      users of thalidomide is an example of such a safeguard; monitoring white
      blood cell counts to detect agranulocytosis (absent white blood cells) in
      users of the antipsychotic drug clozapine is another (see Chapter 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to minimise harms, there is first a need to identify and assess
      the impact of unexpected potential hazards. For most medicines, Â­serious
      ADRs are rare, otherwise their detection would result in the drug not
      reaching (or being withdrawn from) the market. For products that do reach
      the market, serious hazards are seldom identified during preâmarketing
      clinical trials because sample sizes are Â­invariably too small to detect
      them. In addition, the prevailing conditions of clinical trials â selected
      patients, short durations of treatment, close monitoring and specialist
      supervision â usually mean that the frequency of ADRs will be
      underestimated relative to what will really occur in ordinary practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During preâmarketing clinical development and research on new medicines,
      the aims of pharmacovigilance are rather different from the broad public
      health functions described here. In volunteer studies and clinical trials,
      there is a need to protect individuals exposed to experimental products
      (from which they may derive no benefit) from potential harm. There is also
      a need to gather information on risks (including the frequencies at which
      they happen) in order to make a provisional assessment of safety and to
      plan for postâÂ­ marketing safety development (see Risk Management Planning
      in Chapter 5).

      3. Development of Pharmacovigilance
    </h2>
    <p>
      We next consider some of the most important examples of drug safety issues
      and discuss how they have affected the development of pharmacovigilance
      practice from the 1960s to the present day.
    </p>
    <h3 id="31-practolol">3.1. Practolol</h3>
    <p>
      In the early 1970s another drug safety disaster occurred; this was the
      oculoâmucocutaneous syndrome, a multiâsystem disorder, caused by practolol
      (Eraldin), a cardio-selective betaâblocker used to treat angina and
      hypertension. As in the case of thalidomide, several thousand individuals
      were permanently damaged before the association was recognised. The
      fundamental problem in this instance was a failure of timely
      identification, as despite having an early warning system in place, the
      system was dependent on doctors suspecting an association between drug and
      disease. Probably because of the unusual nature of the syndrome â dry
      eyes, skin rash and bowel obstruction â and a long latency period
      (averaging almost 2 years in respect of the onset of the most serious
      bowel manifestations), relevant cases were not reported until the
      association was identified in the medical literature. Around 3000 cases
      were then retrospectively reported to the UK Yellow Card spontaneous ADR
      reporting scheme (see Chapter 3), an example of the potential effect of
      publicity on ADR reporting. Interestingly, subsequent attempts to develop
      an animal model of practolol toxicity failed, indicating that the problem
      could not have been predicted from preâclinical studies.
    </p>
    <h4 id="311-main-lessons-learned-from-practolol">
      3.1.1. Main Lessons Learned from Practolol
    </h4>
    <p>
      Some adverse effects are not predictable from preâclinical studies.
      Spontaneous reporting schemes are not always effective at identify-ing new
      ADRs. Health professionals may not be able to identify long latency
      effects and clinical manifestations not known to be related to other drugs
      as ADRs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional, proactive and more systematic methods of studying
      postâmarketing safety are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overriding message from practolol was that spontaneous ADR reporting
      alone is insufficient as a means of studying postâmarketing safety. Thus,
      in the late 1970s various schemes designed to closely monitor the
      introduction of new drugs were suggested, but few Â­implemented. The basic
      idea was that initial users of new drugs would be identified through
      prescriptions and monitored systematically rather than waiting for someone
      to recognise a possible adverse effect. The concept did come to fruition
      in New Zealand and in England in the late 1970s with the development of
      nationwide prescriptionâevent monitoring (PEM) programmes (see Chapter 3).
    </p>
    <h3 id="32-benoxaprofen">3.2. Benoxaprofen</h3>
    <p>
      The first drug studied by PEM in England was benoxaprofen (Opren), a
      nonâsteroidal antiâinflammatory drug (NSAID) which frequently produced
      photosensitivity reactions (i.e. rashes in lightâexposed areas). A
      published case series from Northern Ireland of five deaths related to
      hepatic and renal failure led to withdrawal of the drug in 1982, although
      the PEM study did not reveal any indication of these effects. Many of the
      patients who experienced serious ADRs with benoxaprofen were elderly; this
      was a result of reduced excretion of the drug as a consequence of renal
      impairment. Even though it is wellârecognised that many patients who use
      NSAIDs are elderly (e.g. for arthritis or chronic pain), benoxaprofen had
      not been adequately studied in this population prior to marketing. A
      reduction in the Â­dosage recommendations for the elderly was implemented
      briefly, but benoxaprofen was withdrawn soon afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the usage of benoxaprofen took off rapidly after launch and an
      important adverse effect â photosensitivity reactions â was common, a
      large number of spontaneous reports were received in a short period of
      time, swamping the primitive computer systems then used and pointing to
      the need for purposeâdesigned databases. The issue also illustrated the
      need for patients to be properly informed about possible ADRs and how to
      minimise the risk â in this case by avoiding exposure to the sun. It was
      therefore influential in moving towards the introduction of patient
      information leaflets, which became compulsory in the European Union (EU)
      during the 1990s.

    <p>
      Uncertainty about cause and effect from individual case reports â further

      of sufficient size.

      elderly). The need for purposeâdesigned computer systems to handle ADR

      the Black Triangle scheme (see Glossary).

    <p>The need for patients to be informed about possible ADRs.</p>
    <p>
      Benoxaprofen was just the first of a series of NSAIDs withdrawn for
      various safety reasons in the 1980s. During this decade, pharmaceutical
      companies started to conduct their own postâmarketing surveil-lance
      studies and UK guidelines related to their conduct were drawn up in 1987.
      However, initially, the value of such studies turned out to be limited
      because they usually lacked comparator groups and often failed to meet the
      planned sample size. The UK guidelines were revised in 1993 with the aim
      of improving the quality of studies. The principles of the revised Safety
      Assessment of Marketed Medicines (SAMM) guidelines also became a blueprint
      for the first EU level guidance on the topic.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4-development-of-pharmacoepidemiology">
      4. Development of Pharmacoepidemiology
    </h2>
    <p>
      Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health
      and disease in populations. During the midâ1980s, the term
      pharmacoepidemiology was first used to mean the scientific disciplineÂ­ of
      the study of drug use and safety at a population level. The discipline
      developed strongly during the 1990s with the increasing use of
      computerised databases containing records of prescriptions and clinical
      outcomes for rapid and efficient study of potential safety hazards. In
      some instances, prescription records are held in a separate database to
      clinical events, and linkage between the two databases needs to be
      achieved (through common identifiers in the two sets of data) in order to
      study adverse events at an individual patient level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the 1980s, pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology
      started to investigate the problem of dependence on benzodiazepines â
      soâcalled minor tranquillisers such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and
      diazepam (Valium) which had been introduced in the 1960s. Advice was
      issued to limit the dosage and duration of such treatments and this issue
      brought into focus the problems faced in dealing with the misuse and abuse
      of prescription drugs. This is another example of a situation where
      spontaneous ADR reporting failed to highlight an important concern, the
      issue eventually coming into focus as a result of pressure from advocates
      for groups of affected patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as the problem of delayed identification of real hazards,
      pharmacovigilance has suffered from the reverse, the apparent
      identification of hazards that turn out not to be real. To some extent
      this is inherent in a system that relies much on clinical suspicions
      sometimesÂ­ these will be wrong. The consequences are that some-times a
      drug is unnecessarily withdrawn, or people become too scared to use it.
      For example, Debendox (or Bendectin), a combination product containing the
      antihistamine doxylamine, was widely used for the treatment of nausea and
      vomiting in pregnancy in the 1970s. It was withdrawn in the early 1980s on
      the basis of concerns that it might cause fetal malformations, a concerted
      campaign against the drug and impending litigation. At the time, the
      evidence of a hazard was very weak, but it was not possible to exclude a
      significant risk to the fetus. Subsequently, many studies of this
      potential association were performed and, collectively, they provided no
      evidence of an increased risk of fetal malformations. This example
      illustrates the intrinsic difficulty of disproving the existence of a
      hazard once concern has been raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more recent, very high profile example illustrating the same point was
      the suggestion made in late 1990s that the combined measles, mumps and
      rubella (MMR) vaccine might be a cause of autism in childrenÂ­.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite there being little evidence for this suggestion, it was impossible
      to completely disprove and hard to convince worried parents. Some years
      later the paper that provoked this concern was discredited and retracted
      but in the meantime vaccine campaigns were damaged and a significant
      number of cases of measles occurred in the UK for the first time in many
      years.

    <h3 id="41-oral%C2%AD-contraceptives-and-pill-scares">
      4.1. OralÂ­ Contraceptives and âPill Scaresâ
    </h3>
    <p>
      This major pharmacovigilance story began in the late 1960s when it was
      discovered through spontaneous ADR reporting and later confirmed in formal
      studies â that combined oral contraceptives (OCs) (containing an estrogen
      and a progestogen) increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      This led to a reduction in the dose of estrogen to 20â30âÂµg
      ethinylestradiol, which lessened (but did not abolish) the risk without
      compromising efficacy. Nevertheless, when the risk of thrombosis became
      public knowledge (highlighted by media âpill scareâ stories in some
      countries), many women became very worried and stopped taking OCs. When
      OCs are stopped abruptly by sexually active women, without immediate use
      of an effective alternative, unintended pregnancies occur and rates of
      induced abortion increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been several âpill scaresâ over the years related to VTE and
      also to other safety issues such as a possible association with myocardial
      infarction and a small increase in the risk of breast cancer. In each of
      these scares, many women stopped using OCs and the public health impact,
      in terms of unintended pregnancies, was considerable. This has been
      particularly unfortunate because pregnancy itself is riskier (with higher
      rates of VTE for example) than using any OC.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1995, a World Health Organization (WHO) study of OCs found a twofold
      increase in the risk of VTE when use of thirdâgeneration (3G) OCs was
      compared with secondâgeneration (2G) OCs. The differenceÂ­ between these
      pills was the progestagen component; Â­desogestrel or gestodene for 3G OCs
      and levonorgestrel for 2G OCs. This was surprising, as it had always been
      considered that VTE risk was simply related to the dose of estrogen in the
      pill. Within about 3 months of the WHO study, the results of two other
      studies reached similar conclusions. Arguments were put forward that the
      associations seen in these studies were not necessarily causal and that 3G
      OCs might have benefits that would compensate for the increase in VTE
      risk. However, there was general agreement that although the relative risk
      of VTE was doubled with 3G pills, the absolute level of risk (see Chapter
      2) was very low, as VTE is rare in healthy young women, even if they take
      the pill. Thus, there was general agreement that 3G OCs should not be
      withdrawn from the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UKâs Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) decided that the emerging
      information on VTE risk should be shared with doctors and patients, but
      faced several challenges around communicating the risks of the OC pill.
      Scare stories had already been published in the British press and despite
      CSM messages that no one should stop taking OCs, many women did, and
      hundreds of unintended pregnancies subsequently occurred. It seemed that
      women had acted on informationÂ­ provided by the mainstream media, rather
      than on advice provided by a national medicines advisory committee.
      Interestingly, the pill scare that occurred in the UK in 1995 was not seen
      in other countries, even those where use of OCs is high. There could be
      many reasons for this, including the role of the British press in risk
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the 1995 pill scare, more studies were carried out and the
      effects of the various progestagens on blood clotting investigated.
      Ultimately, it was shown that there were plausible differential effects of
      these agents on clotting and further pharmacoepidemiological studies have
      now convinced most scientists that the observed association was causal and
      that 2G pills have the lowest risk of VTE. It has also been acknowledged
      that the risk communication tools used in 1995 were inadequate and, in
      many respects, pharmacovigilance risk communication at that time failed to
      prevent serious public health outcomes. In 1997, the WHO convened a
      meeting of experts to consider how communication in pharmacovigilance
      could be improved (see Chapter 4). Since then, there have been other
      significant developments in risk communication for all medicinal products
      and many of these have been informed by lessons learned from OC pill
      scares.

      An important point about the OC issues discussed is that the data on which
      they were based did not, after the initial signal in the 1960s, come from
      spontaneous ADR reporting. Despite that, causation was debatable because
      the studies were not randomised trials but observational
      pharmacoepidemiology studies. VTE is a sufficiently rare out-come in young
      women that it would be extremely difficult to conduct a large enough
      randomized clinical trial to detect a doubling of risk.
    </p>
    <h2 id="5-hormone%C2%AD-replacement-therapy-menopausal-hormone-therapy">
      5. HormoneÂ­ Replacement Therapy (Menopausal Hormone Therapy)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Later in life, women have also been prescribed sex hormones as replacement
      therapy (HRT, now renamed menopausal hormone Â­therapy; MHT). In this age
      group, the baseline risks of VTE, arterial cardiovascular disease and
      various cancers are much greater and therefore it has been more feasible
      to study them in clinical trials, although studies have needed to be large
      and longâterm. Therefore, observational studies of these outcomes were
      performed first and, in general, they appeared to show that HRT reduced
      the risk of arterial disease outcomes such as myocardial infarction and
      stroke. HRT was never authorised for the purpose of reducing
      cardiovascular risk, but in the 1980s and 1990s, on the basis of results
      from observational studies and much pharmaceutical company promotion, it
      was widely used for this purpose. The fundamental problem in performing
      such studies is that women using HRT may be healthier to start with and it
      is difficult to address all possible confounding factors (see Glossary) in
      the design and analysis of observational studies. Another important point
      is that the outcome in question is a benefit (i.e. a reduction in risk)
      and, because of such biases (see Glossary), observational studies rarely
      provide convincing evidence of benefit. It is generally accepted that
      randomized trials are needed to establish efficacy and benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, large randomized trials of HRT were set up (e.g. the Million
      Women Study), but some studies had to be stopped early because they showed
      the opposite of what was expected â an increase in cardiovascular risk.
      Warnings were then issued by regulatory authorities and, because there is
      no major downside to suddenly stop-ping HRT, communication was
      intrinsically easier than with OCs. Indeed, the intended effect of the
      warnings was that women who were inappropriately using longâterm HRT
      should stop taking it. However, conveying the right messages was not
      straightforward because there were multiple risks involved, and they are
      timeâdependent and cannot simply be expressed as a proportion (e.g. 1 in
      100). In 2007, the UK authorities published a report on HRT which included
      estimates of risk for several adverse outcomes, expressed in clear
      language. Since then, further studies of HRT have been published and
      discussion of the risks and benefits of these products continues, and is
      likely to for some time to come.
