## 1. Thalidomide and Introduction

In the beginning, there was thalidomide. The history of drug safety goes back further but, for practical purposes, the story of modern pharmacovigilance begins there.

In the late 1950s there was little, if any, regulation of medicines out-side the USA (where thalidomide was not allowed on to the market), and their testing and development was almost entirely in the hands of pharmaceutical companies. In the case of thalidomide, _unjustified claims of safety in pregnancy were made_, and its use as a sedative and treatment for nausea and vomiting was targeted at pregnant women. The drug turned out to be a **teratogen**, producing a variety of birth defects but particularly limb defects known as phocomelia (Figure 1.1). Worldwide, about 10 000 babies were affected, particularly in Germany where the drug was first marketed. As phocomelia was otherwise a very rare congenital abnormality, a major increase in its incidence did not go unnoticed in Germany, but the cause was initially thought to be environmental. In 1961, a series of just three cases of congenital anomalies associated with thalidomide use in Australia was reported in The Lancet, the problem was finally recognised and the drug with-drawn from sale.

At the beginning of the 1960s, publication of possible adverse effects of drugs in the medical literature was effectively the only mechanism for drawing attention to them. Thalidomide produced a non‐lethal but visible and shocking adverse effect, leading people to ask why so many damaged babies had been born before anything had been done? This question is central to subsequent developments. It is unlikely that we
will ever be able to predict and prevent all the harms that may be caused by medicines, but limiting the damage to much smaller numbers is now achievable. Today we would expect to be able to ­identify an association between drug and outcome analogous to thalidomide and phocomelia after the occurrence of less than 10 cases, so at least three orders of magnitude more effectively than six decades ago.

The overriding lesson learnt from thalidomide was that we cannot just wait until a drug safety problem hits us. The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s led directly to the initial development of the systems we have in place today, although it is only since the early 1990s that the term pharmacovigilance has become widely accepted.

**Pharmacovigilance** is defined by the World Health Organization as _‘The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug‐ related problems.’_ There are other definitions but this very broad one seems to be the most appropriate because there is a clear implication that the process is one of risk management.

This is a concept that is applicable to many aspects of modern life but, surprisingly, its explicit use in relation to pharmaceuticals is a fairly recent development.

Thalidomide is not merely of historical interest, as in recent years it has made a comeback on to the market in some countries but with very narrow indications and extensive safeguards. The reasons for this exemplify the point about risk management, as the risk of fetal malformation can be successfully managed by avoidance of the drug during pregnancy. It also demonstrates another concept that is central to the practice of pharmacovigilance – the balance of benefit and risk. Thalidomide has benefits in some diseases that are otherwise difficult to treat (e.g. refractory multiple myeloma) and these appear to out-weigh the risk of fetal malformation if there is an effective pregnancy prevention scheme in place. A further point that thalidomide illustrates well – and which is relevant to many other drug safety issues – is that not everyone is at the same risk of a particular adverse effect. In this case, a substantial part of the population (including men and also women who are not of childbearing capacity) are not at risk of phocomelia.

### 1.1. Main Lessons Learned from Thalidomide

The thalidomide tragedy taught us many lessons:

- The need for adequate testing of medicines prior to marketing.
- The need for government regulation of medicines.
- The need for reporting systems to identify the adverse effects of medicines.
- The potential safety implications of unproven marketing claims.
- Most medicines cross the placenta and this results in fetal exposure.
- Avoidance of unnecessary use of medicines in pregnancy.
- That some risks can be successfully minimised.

The ramifications of the thalidomide tragedy were manyfold, but the key lesson for the development of pharmacovigilance was that active systems for detecting hazards are needed. Within a few years this had been taken forward with the introduction of voluntary (or ‘spontaneous’) schemes for reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These have stood the test of time as an alerting mechanism or early warning system, and are covered in more detail in Chapter 3.

## 2. Scope­ and Purposes of Pharmacovigilance

In the past, the process of pharmacovigilance has often been considered to start when a drug is first authorised for use in ordinary practice­. Nowadays, it is more commonly considered to include all safety‐related activity beyond the point at which humans are first exposed to a new medicinal product.

The ultimate purpose of pharmacovigilance is to minimise, in practice, the potential for harm that is associated with all active medicines. Although data about all types of ADRs are collected, a key focus is on identifying and preventing those that are defined to be serious. This is generally defined as an ADR that meets at least one of the following criteria:

- Fatal

- Life‐threatening

- Causes or prolongs hospitalisation

- Results in long‐term disability

- All congenital anomalies.

The definition of serious also allows the application of medical judgement, such that a reaction can be considered serious even if there is not clear evidence that one of the above criteria is met. Non‐serious reactions are important to individual patients and health ­professionals involved in their treatment, but they can usually be managed clinically and impact less on the balance of benefit and risk for individual products and on public health in general.

Thus, pharmacovigilance can be seen as a public health function in which reductions in the occurrence of serious harms are achievable through measures that promote the safest possible use of medicinal products and/or provide specific safeguards against known hazards. Pregnancy prevention in users of thalidomide is an example of such a safeguard; monitoring white blood cell counts to detect agranulocytosis (absent white blood cells) in users of the antipsychotic drug clozapine is another (see Chapter 7).

In order to minimise harms, there is first a need to identify and assess the impact of unexpected potential hazards. For most medicines, ­serious ADRs are rare, otherwise their detection would result in the drug not reaching (or being withdrawn from) the market. For products that do reach the market, serious hazards are seldom identified during pre‐marketing clinical trials because sample sizes are ­invariably too small to detect them. In addition, the prevailing conditions of clinical trials – selected patients, short durations of treatment, close monitoring and specialist supervision – usually mean that the frequency of ADRs will be underestimated relative to what will really occur in ordinary practice.

During pre‐marketing clinical development and research on new medicines, the aims of pharmacovigilance are rather different from the broad public health functions described here. In volunteer studies and clinical trials, there is a need to protect individuals exposed to experimental products (from which they may derive no benefit) from potential harm. There is also a need to gather information on risks (including the frequencies at which they happen) in order to make a provisional assessment of safety and to plan for post‐­ marketing safety development (see Risk Management Planning in Chapter 5).

## 3. Development of Pharmacovigilance

We next consider some of the most important examples of drug safety issues and discuss how they have affected the development of pharmacovigilance practice from the 1960s to the present day.

### 3.1. Practolol

In the early 1970s another drug safety disaster occurred; this was the oculo‐mucocutaneous syndrome, a multi‐system disorder, caused by practolol (Eraldin), a cardio-selective beta‐blocker used to treat angina and hypertension. As in the case of thalidomide, several thousand individuals were permanently damaged before the association was recognised. The fundamental problem in this instance was a failure of timely identification, as despite having an early warning system in place, the system was dependent on doctors suspecting an association between drug and disease. Probably because of the unusual nature of the syndrome – dry eyes, skin rash and bowel obstruction – and a long latency period (averaging almost 2 years in respect of the onset of the most serious bowel manifestations), relevant cases were not reported until the association was identified in the medical literature. Around 3000 cases were then retrospectively reported to the UK Yellow Card spontaneous ADR reporting scheme (see Chapter 3), an example of the potential effect of publicity on ADR reporting. Interestingly, subsequent attempts to develop an animal model of practolol toxicity failed, indicating that the problem could not have been predicted from pre‐clinical studies.

#### 3.1.1. Main Lessons Learned from Practolol

Some adverse effects are not predictable from pre‐clinical studies.
Spontaneous reporting schemes are not always effective at identify-ing new ADRs.
Health professionals may not be able to identify long latency effects and clinical manifestations not known to be related to other drugs as ADRs.

Additional, proactive and more systematic methods of studying post‐marketing safety are needed.

The overriding message from practolol was that spontaneous ADR reporting alone is insufficient as a means of studying post‐marketing safety. Thus, in the late 1970s various schemes designed to closely monitor the introduction of new drugs were suggested, but few ­implemented. The basic idea was that initial users of new drugs would be identified through prescriptions and monitored systematically rather than waiting for someone to recognise a possible adverse effect. The concept did come to fruition in New Zealand and in England in the late 1970s with the development of nationwide prescription‐event monitoring (PEM) programmes (see Chapter 3).

### 3.2. Benoxaprofen

The first drug studied by PEM in England was benoxaprofen (Opren), a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) which frequently produced photosensitivity reactions (i.e. rashes in light‐exposed areas). A published case series from Northern Ireland of five deaths related to hepatic and renal failure led to withdrawal of the drug in 1982, although the PEM study did not reveal any indication of these effects. Many of the patients who experienced serious ADRs with benoxaprofen were elderly; this was a result of reduced excretion of the drug as a consequence of renal impairment. Even though it is well‐recognised that many patients who use NSAIDs are elderly (e.g. for arthritis or chronic pain), benoxaprofen had not been adequately studied in this population prior to marketing. A reduction in the ­dosage recommendations for the elderly was implemented briefly, but benoxaprofen was withdrawn soon afterwards.

Because the usage of benoxaprofen took off rapidly after launch and an important adverse effect – photosensitivity reactions – was common, a large number of spontaneous reports were received in a short period of time, swamping the primitive computer systems then used and pointing to the need for purpose‐designed databases. The issue also illustrated the need for patients to be properly informed about possible ADRs and how to minimise the risk – in this case by avoiding exposure to the sun. It was therefore influential in moving towards the introduction of patient information leaflets, which became compulsory in the European Union (EU) during the 1990s.

#### 3.2.1. Main Lessons Learned from Benoxaprofen

Uncertainty about cause and effect from individual case reports – further impetus to the need for formal post‐marketing studies in patient cohorts of sufficient size.

The need to study a drug in populations most likely to use it (e.g. the elderly).
The need for purpose‐designed computer systems to handle ADR reports more promptly and effectively.
The concept of intensive surveillance of new drugs, later achieved in the UK by the introduction of the Black Triangle scheme (see Glossary).

The need for patients to be informed about possible ADRs.

Benoxaprofen was just the first of a series of NSAIDs withdrawn for various safety reasons in the 1980s. During this decade, pharmaceutical companies started to conduct their own post‐marketing surveil-lance studies and UK guidelines related to their conduct were drawn up in 1987. However, initially, the value of such studies turned out to be limited because they usually lacked comparator groups and often failed to meet the planned sample size. The UK guidelines were revised in 1993 with the aim of improving the quality of studies. The principles of the revised Safety Assessment of Marketed Medicines (SAMM) guidelines also became a blueprint for the first EU level guidance on the topic.

## 4. Development of Pharmacoepidemiology

Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in populations. During the mid‐1980s, the term pharmacoepidemiology was first used to mean the scientific discipline­ of the study of drug use and safety at a population level. The discipline developed strongly during the 1990s with the increasing use of computerised databases containing records of prescriptions and clinical outcomes for rapid and efficient study of potential safety hazards. In some instances, prescription records are held in a separate database to clinical events, and linkage between the two databases needs to be achieved (through common identifiers in the two sets of data) in order to study adverse events at an individual patient level.

Towards the end of the 1980s, pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology started to investigate the problem of dependence on benzodiazepines – so‐called minor tranquillisers such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) which had been introduced in the 1960s. Advice was issued to limit the dosage and duration of such treatments and this issue brought into focus the problems faced in dealing with the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs. This is another example of a situation where spontaneous ADR reporting failed to highlight an important concern, the issue eventually coming into focus as a result of pressure from advocates for groups of affected patients.

As well as the problem of delayed identification of real hazards, pharmacovigilance has suffered from the reverse, the apparent identification of hazards that turn out not to be real. To some extent this is inherent in a system that relies much on clinical suspicions sometimes­ these will be wrong. The consequences are that some-times a drug is unnecessarily withdrawn, or people become too scared to use it. For example, Debendox (or Bendectin), a combination product containing the antihistamine doxylamine, was widely used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in the 1970s. It was withdrawn in the early 1980s on the basis of concerns that it might cause fetal malformations, a concerted campaign against the drug and impending litigation. At the time, the evidence of a hazard was very weak, but it was not possible to exclude a significant risk to the fetus. Subsequently, many studies of this potential association were performed and, collectively, they provided no evidence of an increased risk of fetal malformations. This example illustrates the intrinsic difficulty of disproving the existence of a hazard once concern has been raised.

A more recent, very high profile example illustrating the same point was the suggestion made in late 1990s that the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine might be a cause of autism in children­.

Despite there being little evidence for this suggestion, it was impossible to completely disprove and hard to convince worried parents. Some years later the paper that provoked this concern was discredited and retracted but in the meantime vaccine campaigns were damaged and a significant number of cases of measles occurred in the UK for the first time in many years.

### 4.1. Oral­ Contraceptives and ‘Pill Scares’

This major pharmacovigilance story began in the late 1960s when it was discovered through spontaneous ADR reporting and later confirmed in formal studies – that combined oral contraceptives (OCs) (containing an estrogen and a progestogen) increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This led to a reduction in the dose of estrogen to 20–30 µg ethinylestradiol, which lessened (but did not abolish) the risk without compromising efficacy. Nevertheless, when the risk of thrombosis became public knowledge (highlighted by media ‘pill scare’ stories in some countries), many women became very worried and stopped taking OCs. When OCs are stopped abruptly by sexually active women, without immediate use of an effective alternative, unintended pregnancies occur and rates of induced abortion increase.

There have been several ‘pill scares’ over the years related to VTE and also to other safety issues such as a possible association with myocardial infarction and a small increase in the risk of breast cancer. In each of these scares, many women stopped using OCs and the public health impact, in terms of unintended pregnancies, was considerable. This has been particularly unfortunate because pregnancy itself is riskier (with higher rates of VTE for example) than using any OC.

In 1995, a World Health Organization (WHO) study of OCs found a twofold increase in the risk of VTE when use of third‐generation (3G) OCs was compared with second‐generation (2G) OCs. The difference­ between these pills was the progestagen component; ­desogestrel or gestodene for 3G OCs and levonorgestrel for 2G OCs. This was surprising, as it had always been considered that VTE risk was simply related to the dose of estrogen in the pill. Within about 3 months of the WHO study, the results of two other studies reached similar conclusions. Arguments were put forward that the associations seen in these studies were not necessarily causal and that 3G OCs might have benefits that would compensate for the increase in VTE risk. However, there was general agreement that although the relative risk of VTE was doubled with 3G pills, the absolute level of risk (see Chapter 2) was very low, as VTE is rare in healthy young women, even if they take the pill. Thus, there was general agreement that 3G OCs should not be withdrawn from the market.

The UK’s Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) decided that the emerging information on VTE risk should be shared with doctors and patients, but faced several challenges around communicating the risks of the OC pill. Scare stories had already been published in the British press and despite CSM messages that no one should stop taking OCs, many women did, and hundreds of unintended pregnancies subsequently occurred. It seemed that women had acted on information­ provided by the mainstream media, rather than on advice provided by a national medicines advisory committee. Interestingly, the pill scare that occurred in the UK in 1995 was not seen in other countries, even those where use of OCs is high. There could be many reasons for this, including the role of the British press in risk communication.

Following the 1995 pill scare, more studies were carried out and the effects of the various progestagens on blood clotting investigated. Ultimately, it was shown that there were plausible differential effects of these agents on clotting and further pharmacoepidemiological studies have now convinced most scientists that the observed association was causal and that 2G pills have the lowest risk of VTE. It has also been acknowledged that the risk communication tools used in 1995 were inadequate and, in many respects, pharmacovigilance risk communication at that time failed to prevent serious public health outcomes. In 1997, the WHO convened a meeting of experts to consider how communication in pharmacovigilance could be improved (see Chapter 4). Since then, there have been other significant developments in risk communication for all medicinal products and many of these have been informed by lessons learned from OC pill scares.

### 4.2. Main Lessons Learned from the OC Safety Issues

- Drugs are sometimes marketed at a higher dose than is required for efficacy.
- There may be differences in safety between drugs of the same class.
- Harm can result from poor communication of safety warnings.
- When communicating risks of medicines, it is important to distinguish between relative and absolute risks (see Chapter 2) and to explain the difference in plain language.
- Uncertainty and debate about risks can fuel public concern.
- The power of the media to influence users may be greater than the authorities.
- The need for greater international cooperation in pharmacovigilance.
- The need to develop more effective communication tools.
- Risk communication is a specific skill in pharmacovigilance.

An important point about the OC issues discussed is that the data on which they were based did not, after the initial signal in the 1960s, come from spontaneous ADR reporting. Despite that, causation was debatable because the studies were not randomised trials but observational pharmacoepidemiology studies. VTE is a sufficiently rare out-come in young women that it would be extremely difficult to conduct a large enough randomized clinical trial to detect a doubling of risk.

## 5. Hormone­ Replacement Therapy (Menopausal Hormone Therapy)

Later in life, women have also been prescribed sex hormones as replacement therapy (HRT, now renamed menopausal hormone ­therapy; MHT). In this age group, the baseline risks of VTE, arterial cardiovascular disease and various cancers are much greater and therefore it has been more feasible to study them in clinical trials, although studies have needed to be large and long‐term. Therefore, observational studies of these outcomes were performed first and, in general, they appeared to show that HRT reduced the risk of arterial disease outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke. HRT was never authorised for the purpose of reducing cardiovascular risk, but in the 1980s and 1990s, on the basis of results from observational studies and much pharmaceutical company promotion, it was widely used for this purpose. The fundamental problem in performing such studies is that women using HRT may be healthier to start with and it is difficult to address all possible confounding factors (see Glossary) in the design and analysis of observational studies. Another important point is that the outcome in question is a benefit (i.e. a reduction in risk) and, because of such biases (see Glossary), observational studies rarely provide convincing evidence of benefit. It is generally accepted that randomized trials are needed to establish efficacy and benefit.

Eventually, large randomized trials of HRT were set up (e.g. the Million Women Study), but some studies had to be stopped early because they showed the opposite of what was expected – an increase in cardiovascular risk. Warnings were then issued by regulatory authorities and, because there is no major downside to suddenly stop-ping HRT, communication was intrinsically easier than with OCs. Indeed, the intended effect of the warnings was that women who were inappropriately using long‐term HRT should stop taking it. However, conveying the right messages was not straightforward because there were multiple risks involved, and they are time‐dependent and cannot simply be expressed as a proportion (e.g. 1 in 100). In 2007, the UK authorities published a report on HRT which included estimates of risk for several adverse outcomes, expressed in clear language. Since then, further studies of HRT have been published and discussion of the risks and benefits of these products continues, and is likely to for some time to come.
