The difference between an ADR and an AE is crucial and yet these terms are widely misused.
In practice, determining whether a drug is responsible for a particular AE in an individual patient is often difficult and a judgement has to be made (for an explanation of the principles on which this judgement is based see Causality Assessment in Individual Cases).
When the judgement is that the drug is a possible cause, this should be called a suspected ADR.
Reports of such suspicions form the basis of spontaneous ADR reporting schemes and the key point about such data is that they are a subset of all the AEs occurring during drug treatment which someone (generally a health professional who has seen the patient) has identified as possibly being drug-related.
It is the clinician's experience and professional judgement that enables him or her to suspect a drug as the cause but, of course, that suspicion may not be correct.
Proper use of the term AE should imply that a more systematic data collection process has been used so that events will be included, regardless of whether anyone believes they might be caused by a drug.
In most clinical trials it is a standard practice to document all AEs and the best way of determining whether a drug is responsible for a particular type of event from such data is by comparison with a control group.
For example, if 10% of patients exposed to an active drug experienced headache compared to 2% on placebo, then this is an estimate that headache attributable to the drug occurs in 8% (i.e.
10% minus 2%) of patients using it.
In such trials it is also common to ask investigators whether they believe that individual events are related to the drug.
This is effectively another way of collecting suspected ADRs, although such data are likely to be more complete if the patient is in a clinical trial rather than being treated in ordinary practice.
It is important to realise that relying on clinical judgement is a methodologically weaker approach.
Providing that the estimated 8% difference is not based on very small numbers, then it would be more persuasive evidence that the drug causes headache.
Thus, the three terms should be applied in the following contexts: Use ADR to mean that it is now generally accepted that drug x may cause effect y rather than in relation to individual cases.
Qualify the term with 'possible' if there is doubt.
